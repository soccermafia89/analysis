**Understanding the Terms:**

**Two separate phases:**

1. **SPENDING (Earning Points)** - Where/how you spend money:
   - **Portal**: Book through card's travel portal (Chase Travel, Amex Travel, Capital One Travel) → Earns MORE points (e.g., 5x)
   - **Direct**: Book directly with airline/hotel/car rental → Earns FEWER points (e.g., 2x)

2. **REDEMPTION (Using Points)** - How you redeem points later (all cards offer all three options):
   - **Cash/Statement Credit**: Get cash back or statement credit → Lowest value (Chase 1.0¢, Amex 0.6¢, Venture X 1.0¢ for travel)
   - **Portal Redemption**: Use points in card's travel portal → Better value, easy (Chase 1.25¢, Amex 1.0¢ for flights, Venture X 1.0¢)
   - **Transfer Partners**: Transfer to airline/hotel programs (United, Hyatt, etc.) → Best value, more work (Chase 2.05¢, Amex 2.0¢, Venture X 1.85¢)

**Key Point:** Spending and redemption are independent! You can:
- Spend through portal (earn 5x) → Later redeem through portal OR transfer to partners
- Spend direct (earn 2x) → Later redeem through portal OR transfer to partners

**Example:** Spend $100 on flight through Chase Travel (Portal) to earn 500 points (5x). Later, you can:
- Redeem through Chase Travel portal: 500 points × 1.25¢ = **$6.25** value (6.25% return)
- OR transfer to United/Hyatt: 500 points × 2.05¢ = **$10.25** value (10.25% return)

*Note: Row labels show spending method (affects points earned). Each cell shows portal and transfer partner redemption (the better options). Cash redemption is available but gives lower value (see Points to Dollars Conversion table for all options).*

## Break-Even Analysis: Spending Needed to Earn Back Credit Value

*Break-even spending = Credit Spending + (Annual Fee - Credit Value) ÷ Effective Return Rate. Credit Value (A) is the yearly credit received. We need A + (X × Effective Return Rate) = Annual Fee, so X = (Annual Fee - A) ÷ Effective Return Rate. Break-even = Credit Spending + X.*

### Minimum Scenario (Worst Case)
**Direct Booking + Portal Redemption** - Book directly with airlines/hotels, redeem through card's travel portal

#### Air Travel Break-Even

| Card | Credit Value | Break-Even Spending | Effective Return Rate |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Chase Sapphire Preferred** | $50 | $1,850<br>($50 + $1,800 at 2.5%) | 2.5% |
| **Amex Gold** | $240 | $573<br>($240 + $333 at 3.0%) | 3.0% |
| **Capital One Venture X** | $400 | $300<br>($300 + $0 at 2.0%) | 2.0% |

#### Hotels Break-Even

| Card | Credit Value | Break-Even Spending | Effective Return Rate |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Chase Sapphire Preferred** | $50 | $1,850<br>($50 + $1,800 at 2.5%) | 2.5% |
| **Amex Gold** | $240 | $1,907<br>($240 + $1,667 at 0.6%) | 0.6% |
| **Capital One Venture X** | $400 | $300<br>($300 + $0 at 2.0%) | 2.0% |

### Maximum Scenario (Best Case)
**Portal Booking + Transfer Partners** - Book through card's travel portal, redeem via transfer partners

#### Air Travel Break-Even

| Card | Credit Value | Break-Even Spending | Effective Return Rate |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Chase Sapphire Preferred** | $50 | $489<br>($50 + $439 at 10.25%) | 10.25% |
| **Amex Gold** | $240 | $407<br>($240 + $167 at 6.0%) | 6.0% |
| **Capital One Venture X** | $400 | $300<br>($300 + $0 at 9.25%) | 9.25% |

#### Hotels Break-Even

| Card | Credit Value | Break-Even Spending | Effective Return Rate |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Chase Sapphire Preferred** | $50 | $489<br>($50 + $439 at 10.25%) | 10.25% |
| **Amex Gold** | $240 | $740<br>($240 + $500 at 2.0%) | 2.0% |
| **Capital One Venture X** | $400 | $300<br>($300 + $0 at 18.5%) | 18.5% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Venture X**: Effectively free if you use all credits, so no break-even needed
- **Chase Sapphire Preferred**: Break-even ranges from $439 (best) to $1,800 (worst) - 4x difference!
- **Amex Gold**: Best for air travel ($167-$333), but hotels require much more ($500-$1,667)
- Maximum scenario requires 60-75% less spending than minimum scenario
- Portal booking + transfer partners provides the best value

*Break-even = Credit Spending + (Annual Fee - Credit Value) ÷ Effective Return Rate. Credit Value (A) is yearly credit received. We need A + (X × Effective Return Rate) = Annual Fee, so X = (Annual Fee - A) ÷ Effective Return Rate. Break-Even Spending shows total spending needed (credit spending breakdown shown in parentheses).*
